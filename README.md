# Virtual_Zoom_Gesture

I have created a virtual zoom gesture where we can Zoom in and Zoom out any image and even we can move that image anywhere on the screen by just using our hands

Modules i have used are OpenCV and CVZone

CVZone-: It's basically a Computer Vision Package that makes its easy to run Image processing and AI functions. At the core it uses OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries.
